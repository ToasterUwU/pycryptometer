# pycryptometer - API Wrapper for "cryptometer.io"

This is a small API Wrapper. It contains all the API endpoints that exist. This package will be updated whenever there are new endpoints. 

(Nope, not anymore since the API Devs promised to cooperate but revoked my premium access (that i needed for testing) and dont tell me about updates like they promised)


# Usage

## Installing the package:

```pip install pycryptometer```

## Using it:

```py
from pycryptometer import Cryptometer

c = Cryptometer("YOUR_API_KEY")
syntax = c.ANY_OF_THE_CATEGORIES.ANY_OF_THE_FUNCTIONS(THE_ARGS_IT_NEEDS)
example = c.infos.market_list("binance")
```
Every function will return either of the following things:

- list
- dictonary
- list filled with dictonarys
- dictonary filled with lists
